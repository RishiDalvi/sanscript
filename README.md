# Sansript: A Sanskrit-Based Programming Language  

**Sansript** is a programming language inspired by the rich heritage of Sanskrit. It allows users to write code in Sanskrit, adhering to a modern programming paradigm, and supports execution by translating Sanskrit code into Python.  

## 🔗 Website  
Explore the language and try it online at: [Sansript Playground](https://Sansript.vercel.app/)

## 🌟 Features  
- **Write Code in Sanskrit**: Use Sanskrit-based syntax for writing programs.  
- **Modules for Language Processing**:
  - **Tokenizer**: Processes the code into tokens.  
  - **Parser**: Generates the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).  
  - **Validator**: Validates the AST for correctness.  
  - **Code Generator**: Converts the AST into Python code.  
  - **Executor**: Executes the generated Python code.  
- **Playground**: A web-based code editor for writing and testing Sansript programs.  
- **Client-Side Execution**: Powered by [Pyodide](https://pyodide.org/), Python code runs directly in the browser.  
- **Documentation**: Detailed features and syntax are available in `documentation.md`.
